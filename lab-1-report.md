Brandon Phan, Lab 1 Report

1) cd with no arguments
[insert image here
Absolute Path: /Users/brandonphan/lecture1
Explanation: I did not get an output, but it did change my working directory to the root directory, `/Users/brandonphan`.I assume since I provided no arguments, it defaulted to sending me to the root directory.
Error or Not: The output is not an error.
