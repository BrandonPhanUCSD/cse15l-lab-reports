### Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

1. Piazza Post

Summary: Test Fail for ChatServer, Need Help.

Details: I've been working on the ArrayExamples assignment for a while, but I can't seem to figure out why my averageWithoutLowest method is not working. 
When I run the test script, I get the following error message: ![image](student-symptom-report.png). 

I've attached a picture of my method below. What am I doing wrong? Is my lowest number searcher code not working somehow? ![image](buggy-code.png).

2. Instructor Response:

Response: Your test seems to be getting 3 as the output for your test while it expects 4. What possible reasons are there for a mean average to be undercounted? The code to find the lowest number looks good! It is something else that needs to be addressed.

3. Bug fixing:

![image](fixed-code.png)

Student: Taking your message into account, I realized that I would get an output of 3 instead of 4 if I were to divide my average by 4 instead of 3, respectively. Therefore, I realized I had an off-by-one error in the denominator and realized I overcounted what I divided my sum by.

4. Necessary Information

File & Directory Structure: ![image](file+directory_structure.png)

Contents of Each File:

ArrayExamples.java:

```
public class ArrayExamples {

  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int[] temp = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      temp[i] = arr[i];
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = temp[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }

  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }

  // Averages the numbers in the array (takes the mean), but leaves out the
  // lowest number when calculating. Returns 0 if there are no elements or just
  // 1 element in the array
  static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
    if(arr.length < 2) { return 0.0; }
    double lowest = arr[0];
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num < lowest) { lowest = num; }
    }
    double sum = 0.0;
    for(double num: arr) {
      sum += num;
    }
    return (sum-lowest) / (arr.length);
  }


}
```

ArrayTests.java

```
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {
	@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3, 2, 1 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 }, input1);
	}


  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { 0, 1, 2};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 2, 1, 0 }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }

  @Test
  public void testAverageWithoutLowest() {
    double[] input1 = { 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 9.0};
    assertEquals(4.0, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.01);
  }
}
```

test.sh:

```
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java

java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests
```

The command ran to trigger the bug: `bash test.sh`

What to edit to fix the bug: On the last line of the averageWithoutLowest method, you have to make sure to subtract a 1 when you divide the sum of the non-lowest numbers to find the mean in order to account for taking out the lowest number from the average. In other words, change the line `return (sum-lowest) / (arr.length);` to `return (sum-lowest) / (arr.length - 1);`.

### Part 2, Reflection

Something new I learned from my lab experience in this second half of the quarter was how to run the java debugger! Before this class, I had to use a bunch of print statements in order to debug my code. Now, I can use the java debugger in order to help me with my coding assignments. I also learned VIM for the first time, and it was interesting to learn how to edit things without even leaving the terminal!
