Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` 

`<command>` `v` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then wrote `git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` as that is the command to clone a repository. I then did <command>` + `v` in order to paste the link to the repository, which is `https://github.com/BrandonPhanUCSD/lab7` which I had copied from before Step 4.

Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`cd` `<space>` `lab7` `<enter>` 

`ls` `<enter>`

`bash` `<space>` `test.sh` `<enter>`
