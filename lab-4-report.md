### Lab 4, VIM

Step 4: Log into ieng6

![image](step-4.png)

Keys Pressed: 

`ssh` `<space>` `b3phan@ieng6.ucsd.edu` `<enter>`

I typed out the command to log into ieng6, which was `ssh` `<space>` `b3phan@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. I then clicked enter to run the command.

Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

![image](step-5.png)

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` 

`<command>` `v` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then wrote `git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` as that is the command to clone a repository. I then did `<command>` + `v` in order to paste the link to the repository, which is `https://github.com/BrandonPhanUCSD/lab7` which I had copied from before Step 4.

Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

![image](step-6.png)

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`cd` `<space>` `lab7` `<enter>` 

`ls` `<enter>`

`bash` `<space>` `test.sh` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then changed my directory into the `lab7` directory by typing out `cd` `<space>` `lab7`. I then used the 'ls' command in order to find the name of the script I had to run since I forgot the name. I then ran that script by typing `bash` `<space>` `test.sh`, which ran the bash script `test.sh`.
