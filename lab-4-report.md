### Lab 4, VIM

Step 4: Log into ieng6

![image](step-4.png)

Keys Pressed: 

`ssh` `<space>` `b3phan@ieng6.ucsd.edu` `<enter>`

I typed out the command to log into ieng6, which was `ssh` `<space>` `b3phan@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. I then clicked enter to run the command.

Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

![image](step-5.png)

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` 

`<command>` `v` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then wrote `git` `<space>` `clone` `<space>` as that is the command to clone a repository. I then did `<command>` + `v` in order to paste the link to the repository, which is `https://github.com/BrandonPhanUCSD/lab7` which I had copied from before Step 4.

Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys Pressed: 

`clear` `<enter>` 

`cd` `<space>` `lab7` `<enter>` 

`ls` `<enter>`

`bash` `<space>` `test.sh` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then changed my directory into the `lab7` directory by typing out `cd` `<space>` `lab7`. I then used the `ls` command in order to find the name of the script I had to run since I forgot the name. I then ran that script by typing `bash` `<space>` `test.sh`, which ran the bash script `test.sh`.

Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

![image](step-7-2.png)

Keys Pressed:

`vim` `<space>` `ListExamples.java` `<enter>`

`40` `j` `j` `j` `12` `l` `h`

`r` `2` 

`<command>` `<shift>` `4`

`<shift>` `:` `wq` `<enter>`

In order to edit the code, I used vim to fix ListExamples.java by running the command `vim` `<space>` `ListExamples.java`. I then navigated to the error by using the following commands: `40` `j` `j` `j` `12` `l` `h`. I then replaced index1 with index2 by using vim's replacement command: `r` `2`. I then took a screenshot for this lab by inputting `<command>` `<shift>` `4`. Finally, I saved and quit the java file using `<shift>` `:` `wq`.

---

Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

![image](step-8.png)

Keys Pressed:

`clear` `<enter>` 

`bash` `<space>` `test.sh` `<enter>`

I used the `clear` command to get a clear screenshot of the next command. I then ran that script by typing `bash` `<space>` `test.sh`, which ran the bash script `test.sh`.
