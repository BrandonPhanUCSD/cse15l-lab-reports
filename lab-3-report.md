Bugs

Before Code:
```
  static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index1 < list1.size() && index2 < list2.size()) {
      if(list1.get(index1).compareTo(list2.get(index2)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    return result;
  }
```

After Code:
```
  static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index1 < list1.size() && index2 < list2.size()) {
      if(list1.get(index1).compareTo(list2.get(index2)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      index2 += 1;
    }
    return result;
  }
```

Explanation

The bug with the original code was in the third while loop, which activates when the second given list isn't cycled through in the first while loop, it was incrementing index1 instead of index2. This led to an infinite loop. The fix is to change it to index2, which fixes the infinite loop. 


## Part 2 - Researching Commands

I am choosing the find command. I have `cd`ed into the `./techinical` directory. 

First Option: -find

Citation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/#

Example 1:
```
Input:
find ./ -type d

Output:
./
.//government
.//government/About_LSC
.//government/Env_Prot_Agen
.//government/Alcohol_Problems
.//government/Gen_Account_Office
.//government/Post_Rate_Comm
.//government/Media
.//plos
.//biomed
.//911report
```
This command finds all the directories in the `./techinical` directory. It is useful if you only need directory paths, such as if you are putting the output as an argument into a command that only accepts directory paths.


Example 2: 
```
Input:
find ./911report -type f

Output:
./911report/chapter-13.4.txt
./911report/chapter-13.5.txt
./911report/chapter-13.1.txt
./911report/chapter-13.2.txt
./911report/chapter-13.3.txt
./911report/chapter-3.txt
./911report/chapter-2.txt
./911report/chapter-1.txt
./911report/chapter-5.txt
./911report/chapter-6.txt
./911report/chapter-7.txt
./911report/chapter-9.txt
./911report/chapter-8.txt
./911report/preface.txt
./911report/chapter-12.txt
./911report/chapter-10.txt
./911report/chapter-11.txt
```
This command finds all the files in the `./techinical/911report` directory. It is useful if you only need file paths, such as if you are putting the output as an argument into a command that only accepts file paths.

Second Option: -name 

Citation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/#

Example 1:
```
Input:
find ./ -name "*cat*"

Output:
.//government/Media/Advocate_for_Poor.txt
```
This command finds all the paths in the `./techinical` directory that has the string "cat" contained somewhere in the name, which is useful for searching for specific terms. 


Example 2:
```
Input:
find ./ -name "*ow*"

Output:
.//government/Media/help_rent-to-own_tenants.txt
.//government/Media/It_Pays_to_Know.txt
.//government/Media/Low-income_children.txt
.//government/Media/Towson_Attorney.txt
.//government/Media/Pro-bono_road_show.txt
```
This command finds all the paths in the `./techinical` directory that has the string "ow" contained somewhere in the name, which is useful for searching for specific terms. 

Third Option: -mindepth

Citation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/#

Example 1:
```
Input:
find ./ -mindepth 2 -type d

Output:
.//government/About_LSC
.//government/Env_Prot_Agen
.//government/Alcohol_Problems
.//government/Gen_Account_Office
.//government/Post_Rate_Comm
.//government/Media
```
This command finds all directories that are at least 2 deep into the directory `./technical`. It is useful if you want to search through a directory but don't results from the top layers of the directory. 

Example 2:
```
Input:
find ./government -mindepth 2 -type f
 
Output:

This command finds all files that are at least 2 deep into the directory `./technical/government`. It is useful if you want to search through a directory but don't results from the top layers of the directory. 

Fourth Option: -size [+/-] n

Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/#

Example 1: 
```
Input: find ./biomed -size +130

Output:
./biomed/gb-2003-4-5-r34.txt
./biomed/gb-2001-2-7-research0025.txt
./biomed/gb-2002-3-7-research0036.txt

./biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt
./biomed/1476-069X-2-9.txt
```
This command finds all the files in the directory `./technical/biomed` that have more than 130 characters. It is useful if you need to find large files for things like clearing out computer memory. 

Example 2:
```
Input:
find ./ -size -5 -type f

Output:
.//government/Media/Helping_Hands.txt
.//government/Media/Campaign_Pays.txt
.//government/Media/Fire_Victims_Sue.txt

.//plos/pmed.0020157.txt
.//plos/pmed.0020082.txt
.//plos/pmed.0020120.txt
```
This command finds all the files in the directory `./technical` that have less than 5 characters. It is useful if you need to find small files for things like finding small junk files.
